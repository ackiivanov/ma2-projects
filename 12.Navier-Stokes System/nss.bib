ABSTRACT = {Multigrid methods (MGMs) are used for discretized systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) which arise from finite difference approximation of the incompressible Navier&ndash;Stokes equations. After discretization and linearization of the equations, systems of linear algebraic equations (SLAEs) with a strongly non-Hermitian matrix appear. Hermitian/skew-Hermitian splitting (HSS) and skew-Hermitian triangular splitting (STS) methods are considered as smoothers in the MGM for solving the SLAE. Numerical results for an algebraic multigrid (AMG) method with HSS-based smoothers are presented.},
