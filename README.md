# ma2-projects

This is a repository of all the projects I have done as part of
the content of the course "Model Analysis 2" ("Modelska Analiza 2").
It contains different methods for solving partial differential
equations, as this was the biggest focus of the course, with some
interesting visualizations too.

It also includes a final project about investigating a system of
coupled Kuramoto oscillators, and applying various analytical,
numerical and statistical techniques to explore the motion of the
oscillators and the different possible stationary states that the
system can end up in.
